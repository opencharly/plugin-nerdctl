# AGENTS.md — plugin-nerdctl

Standalone out-of-tree plugin repo serving the `engine:nerdctl` engine backend
(`engine:nerdctl` + `verb:nerdctl` + `command:nerdctl`). The plugin is a Go
module at `candy/plugin-nerdctl/` (module path
`github.com/opencharly/plugin-nerdctl/candy/plugin-nerdctl`); the root
`charly.yml` declares `discover: box` + `discover: candy` so the repo is a
project and its candy is scanned.

Canonical files:

- `candy/plugin-nerdctl/charly.yml` — the `plugin-nerdctl:` candy entity
  (`plugin:` block, `plan:` checks) and the embedded `plugin-nerdctl-skill:`
  skill entity.
- `candy/plugin-nerdctl/` — the Go source: `plugin.go` (provider + meta),
  `schema/plugin.cue`, `cmd/serve/main.go`.
- `README.md` — user overview only; never agent guidance.

The repo carries **no** per-repo workflow file; the org-wide required workflow is
what gates the merge.

## Load these skills first (R0)

- `/charly-internals:plugin-nerdctl` — the `engine:nerdctl` provider reference
  (projected from this candy's own `plugin-nerdctl-skill:` entity). Load before
  changing an engine op.
- `/charly-internals:plugin` — the plugin authoring reference: the `plugin:`
  block, the unified Provider model, the per-plugin CUE-schema contract,
  placement.
- `/charly-distros:layer-nerdctl` — the packages + rootless
  containerd/buildkit/CNI stack this plugin composes with.
- `/charly-internals:git-workflow` — before any git/PR action.

## Build / validate / test

- `go build ./...` in `candy/plugin-nerdctl/` — compile the plugin module.
- `go test ./...` in `candy/plugin-nerdctl/` — the plugin's Go tests.
- `charly box validate` at the repo root — the structural check (the candy +
  `plugin:` block, CUE schema).
- The merge gate is the **org-wide** `charly/pr-validator` (required check
  `validate / validate`, defined in `opencharly/.github`); this repo has **no**
  per-repo candy gate.

## Modify this repo

- Edit the `plugin-nerdctl:` candy entity, the Go source, and `schema/plugin.cue`
  **together** — the schema is the served declaration surface.
- Keep the delegation to `container.InvokeEngineOp("nerdctl", …)` in the spec
  module: the engine class has ONE implementation served from either placement.
  Do not fork the engine body here.
- Keep the `plugin-nerdctl-skill:` entity in step with any provider-surface
  change — it is the projected source for `/charly-internals:plugin-nerdctl`.

## Landing

Load `/charly-internals:git-workflow` before any git/PR action; it owns the
landing mechanics. The authoritative rulebook is the umbrella `AGENTS.md` in
`opencharly/opencharly` and `charly/AGENTS.md` in the charly repo.
